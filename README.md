# 📌 Ecommerce Chatbot
A GenAI-powered customer service chatbot designed for an e-commerce clothing company. Built with **LangChain, Pinecone, Groq, llama3.3 70b model**. The chatbot provides product recommendations, processes orders, tracks shipments, and remembers past conversations for a seamless user experience. The full pipeline — from data collection to chatbot deployment — is automated and orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**, enabling scalable and production-grade MLOps workflows.

<br>

## 🎯 Project Overview
### 1. Data Collection
- The first step in our project was collecting **real world product data** from Amazon.
- Implemented automated web scraping using Selenium to extract product information from Amazon.
- Targeted different product categories including:
    - Formal Shirts for men
    - Sarees for women
    - Watches for men
- For each category the below details has been collected:
    - Brand name
    - Product name
    - Rating
    - Rating counts
    - Selling Price
    - MRP (original price)
    - Offer percentage

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing on the collected dataset
- Handled missing values in ratings, rating counts, and other relevant columns
- Applied mode imputation to replace missing values as most of the columns are categorical

### 3. Vector Embedding
- Leveraged NVIDIA's embedding model "nv-embedqa-mistral-7b-v2" for vector embeddings
- Selected this model based on its top performance on the MTEB leaderboard
- Implemented embedding generation through the LangChain framework

### 4. Loading the Embeddings to Pinecone Vector Store
- Transferred generated embeddings to Pinecone, Pinecone is a purpose-built vector database for AI applications
- First created a Pinecone index using Python and 
- Uploaded the embeddings to the index to enable semantic search capabilities

### 5. LLM Model and Prompt Engineering
- Integrated "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" model via Groq through the LangChain framework
- Selected Groq for its significant enhancements in computational efficiency and response speed
- Developed optimized prompts with specific instructions and guidelines to maximize model performance and response

### 6. Setting up RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Setup the Pinecone vector store as an retriever
- Created document chain after LLM and prompt configuration
- Created retrieval chain utilizing both the retriever and document chain
- Finally our fully functional RAG-based chatbot system is to be used

### 7. Flask Web Application
- Developed a web interface using Flask framework
- Created an e-commerce website with integrated chatbot functionality using HTML and CSS
- Handled the chatbot receive and response part through javascript.    
- The final result delivers a user experience that is similar in a interaction with a customer service representative of a clothing company

### 8. MLOps Integration with Apache Airflow
- Integrated Apache Airflow to orchestrate the complete data pipeline.
- Each pipeline stage is defined as a task:
    - Data Collection DAG: Scrapes product data from Amazon using Selenium.
    - Data Cleaning DAG: Cleans and preprocesses raw product data.
    - Vector Store Builder DAG: Embeds product data and stores it in Pinecone.
    - Chatbot Builder DAG: Builds and updates the chatbot using LLaMA and LangChain.
- The pipeline runs daily at a scheduled time automatically as a result the chatbot gets trained with new product data. 
- Enables better automation, monitoring, retry handling.

<br>

# 🚀 Features
- **MLOps Orchestration**: Automates and monitors the entire pipeline with **Apache Airflow**.
- **Product Recommendations**: Suggests products based on user queries and budget.
- **Order Processing**: Handles multiple items, calculates totals, and generates order confirmations.
- **Order Tracking**: Provides real-time order status updates.
- **Conversational Memory**: Retains chat history using **LangGraph** for better interactions.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Uses **Pinecone** for fast, relevant document retrieval.

<br>

# 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Flask** (Flask for Web Interface)
- **Apache Airflow** (MLOps pipeline orchestration)
- **Selenium** (For Webscraping amazon website)
- **LangChain** (LLM integration & retrieval-augmented generation)
- **Pinecone** (Vector database for retrieval)
- **GROQ API** (GROQ for accessing Llama 3.3 70b model)
- **HTML & CSS** (Frontend for chatbot UI)
